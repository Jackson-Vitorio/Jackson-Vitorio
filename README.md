### My skills are mainly focused on programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and PHP, and I am always learning and exploring new technologies related to AI development, Databases, and APIs. I have experience with popular frameworks like Django, and I am familiar with both relational and non-relational databases such as MySQL and SQLite3.
### I am always interested in technical challenges and learning new technologies. Besides software development, I also enjoy sharing knowledge and contributing to the open-source community. You can find some of my projects on my GitHub profile.
